## Current Project State

**Session Date:** September 5, 2025, 13:05  
**Branch:** feature/sliding-panel  
**Major Work Completed:** Layout system conversion from CSS Grid to absolute positioning

## Recent Session Work Summary

### 1. Layout System Overhaul
**Problem:** Original CSS Grid layout with `grid-template-columns: 250px 1fr 250px` created ambiguous dimensions and border interference issues.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Converted entire layout from CSS Grid to absolute positioning
- Achieved pixel-perfect control over panel placement
- Eliminated border interference between panels

### 2. Exact Dimension Testing and Correction
**Testing Process:**
- Created multiple test images (740×680, 778×720, 780×714, 780×720)
- Discovered positioning gaps and border interference
- Iteratively refined dimensions through visual testing

**Final Resolution:**
- **Maximum game area:** 780px × 720px at position (0,0)
- Removed all padding from center game panel
- Positioned all panels at top: 0 (not top: 3px) due to box-sizing: border-box

### 3. Panel Positioning (Final Configuration)
- **Left Panel:** position absolute at (0, 0), 250×720px, includes 2px right border
- **Center Panel:** position absolute at (250px, 0), 780×720px, no borders, no padding  
- **Right Panel:** position absolute at (1030px, 0), 250×720px, includes 2px left border

## Current Game Status

### Fully Implemented Games
1. **Title Screen (game-0.js)** - 31 lines, static welcome
2. **Find the Pumpkin (game-1.js)** - 291 lines, WASD movement game
   - Needs boundary update: maxY should be 620px (was 580px) for new 720px height
3. **Candy Swap (candy-swap.js)** - 512 lines, complex trading simulation

### Placeholder Games (Ready for Development)
4. **Spider Web (game-3.js)** - 75 lines, click interaction placeholder
5. **Bat Cave (game-4.js)** - 75 lines, treasure hunting placeholder  
6. **Witch's Brew (game-5.js)** - 74 lines, potion mixing placeholder

### Temporary Development Tool
7. **Test Size (test-size.js)** - Development tool for dimension verification
   - **Status:** TEMPORARY - should be removed once testing complete
   - Displays 780×720 test image with corner markers
   - Provides console logging for dimension verification

## Immediate Next Steps

### High Priority (Complete Current Work)
1. **Test the final layout** - Verify 780×720 test image displays perfectly
2. **Remove test-size game** - Clean up temporary testing code once verified
3. **Update Find the Pumpkin boundaries** - Change maxY from 580px to 620px

### Development Ready Tasks
1. **Implement Spider Web game** - Expand beyond placeholder
2. **Implement Bat Cave game** - Add treasure hunting mechanics
3. **Implement Witch's Brew game** - Add potion mixing gameplay

### Game Development Guidelines (Established)
- **Full-size games:** Use entire 780×720px space at position (0,0)
- **Smaller games:** Center using calculated offsets, e.g., 600×500 game at (90px, 110px)
- **No padding constraints:** Games control their own spacing/margins

## Technical Achievements

### Layout Precision
- Achieved exact pixel control over all panel dimensions
- Eliminated CSS Grid ambiguity with "1fr" calculations
- Fixed border ownership (borders belong to side panels, not center)

### Game Area Maximization
- Increased available game space from ~740×674px to 780×720px
- Removed padding constraints from center panel
- Maintained visual appeal with proper panel borders

### Development Workflow
- Established systematic dimension testing approach
- Created visual verification tools for layout accuracy
- Documented exact positioning calculations

## Files Modified This Session

### Core Layout Files
- `css/styles.css` - Complete layout system conversion
- `index.html` - Added Test Size menu item

### Game Files  
- `js/games/test-size.js` - Created dimension testing tool
- `js/main.js` - Added test-size game to registry

### Documentation
- `specifications.md` - Updated with absolute positioning details
- `specifications-technical.md` - Created (technical implementation details)
- `Claude-ToBeContinued-2025-0905-1305.md` - This file

### Test Assets
- `test-size-780x720-final.svg` - Final dimension verification image
- Previous test images (can be cleaned up)

## Long-term Considerations

### Responsive Design
- Current system is fixed 1280×720px (non-responsive)
- Future enhancement: Add responsive breakpoints
- Consider viewport scaling for mobile devices

### Game Development Philosophy
- Maintain incremental development approach
- Prioritize simple, understandable implementations
- Build on established absolute positioning foundation

### Code Quality
- Well-documented codebase with clear separation of concerns
- Clean absolute positioning system ready for expansion
- Established patterns for new game development

**Next Developer Notes:**
The layout system is now solid and precise. Focus should shift to expanding the placeholder games into full implementations. The Test Size game should be removed once final verification is complete. The Find the Pumpkin game boundaries need a minor update for the new height.
